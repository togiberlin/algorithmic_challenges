Have the function ```MeanMode(arr)``` take the array of numbers stored in ```arr``` and return **1** if the mode equals the mean, **0** if they don't equal each other (**ie.** [5, 3, 3, 3, 1] should return **1** because the mode (3) equals the mean (3)). The array will not be empty, will only contain positive integers, and will not contain more than one mode.
