Have the function ```StringPeriods(str)``` take the ```str``` parameter being passed and determine if there is some substring K that can be repeated N > 1 times to produce the input string exactly as it appears. Your program should return the longest substring K, and if there is none it should return the string **-1**.

For example: if ```str``` is "abcababcababcab" then your program should return **abcab** because that is the longest substring that is repeated 3 times to create the final string. Another example: if ```str``` is "abababababab" then your program should return **ababab** because it is the longest substring. If the input string contains only a single character, your program should return the string **-1**.
