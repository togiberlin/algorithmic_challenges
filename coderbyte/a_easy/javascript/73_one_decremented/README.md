Have the function ```OneDecremented(num)``` count how many times a digit appears that is exactly one less than the previous digit. For example: if ```num``` is 5655984 then your program should return **2** because 5 appears directly after 6 and 8 appears directly after 9. The input will always contain at least 1 digit.
