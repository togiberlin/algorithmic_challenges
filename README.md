# Coderbyte
[Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com) is a page, where you can improve your knowledge of programming languages like e.g. **Ruby**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, **Go**, **Swift**, **C**, **C++** or **C#**.

Learning, improving and maintaining a programming language is pretty straightforward. Similar to natural languages, you need to keep the following things sharp:
- Vocabulary
- Syntax & semantics
- Grammar
- Style

*Note: Unfortunately, Coderbyte doesn't stick to Ruby's snake_case convention. You will see mixed usage of camelCase and snake_case.*

## How to Practice Programming Language Fluency
- Solve all easy problems. When stuck, look stuff up.
- Review your solutions and refactor them.
- Note down all used methods, make flashcards and memorize expected input and output of relevant methods.
- Solve all easy problems again *without* looking stuff up. Try to solve each problem *within 10-15 minutes*.

## Important Ruby Libraries
As you keep solving problems, you will familiarize with useful, basic Ruby libraries. Below, you will see Ruby libraries, which were used the most for solving problems.

### Used Every Time
- [String](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.2/String.html)
