# Coderbyte
[Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com) is a page, where you can improve your knowledge of programming languages like e.g. **Ruby**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, **Go**, **Swift**, **C**, **C++** or **C#**.

Learning, improving and maintaining a programming language is pretty straightforward. Similar to natural languages, you need to keep the following things sharp:
- Vocabulary
- Syntax & semantics
- Grammar
- Style

*Note: Unfortunately, Coderbyte doesn't stick to Ruby's snake_case convention. You will see mixed usage of camelCase and snake_case.*

## Essential Ruby Libraries
