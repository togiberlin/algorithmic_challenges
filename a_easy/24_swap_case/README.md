Have the function ```SwapCase(str)``` take the ```str``` parameter and swap the case of each character. For example: if ```str``` is "Hello World" the output should be **hELLO wORLD**. Let numbers and symbols stay the way they are.

Use the **Parameter Testing** feature in the box below to test your code with different arguments.
