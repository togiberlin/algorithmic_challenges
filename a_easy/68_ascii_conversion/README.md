Have the function ```ASCIIConversion(str)``` take the ```str``` parameter being passed and return a new string where every character, aside from the space character, is replaced with its corresponding decimal ASCII character code. For example: if ```str``` is "dog" then your program should return the string **100111103** because d = 100, o = 111, g = 103.
