Have the function ```PalindromeSwapper(str)``` take the ```str``` parameter being passed and determine if a palindrome can be created by swapping two adjacent characters in the string. If it is possible to create a palindrome, then your program should return the palindrome, if not then return the string **-1**. The input string will only contain alphabetic characters. For example: if ```str``` is "rcaecar" then you can create a palindrome by swapping the second and third characters, so your program should return the string **racecar** which is the final palindromic string.
