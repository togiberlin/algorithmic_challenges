Have the function ```VowelCount(str)``` take the ```str``` string parameter being passed and return the number of vowels the string contains (**ie.** "All cows eat grass and moo" would return 8). Do not count **y** as a vowel for this challenge.

Use the **Parameter Testing** feature in the box below to test your code with different arguments.
