Using the Ruby language, have the function ```DivisionStringified(num1,num2)``` take both parameters being passed, divide ```num1``` by ```num2```, and return the result as a string with properly formatted commas. If an answer is only 3 digits long, return the number with no commas (**ie.** 2 / 3 should output "1"). For example: if ```num1``` is 123456789 and ```num2``` is 10000 the output should be "12,346".
