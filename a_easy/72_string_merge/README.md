Have the function ```StringMerge(str)``` read the ```str``` parameter being passed which will contain a large string of alphanumeric characters with a single asterisk character splitting the string evenly into two separate strings. Your goal is to return a new string by pairing up the characters in the corresponding locations in both strings. For example: if ```str``` is "abc1*kyoo" then your program should return the string **akbyco1o** because a pairs with k, b pairs with y, etc. The string will always split evenly with the asterisk in the center.
