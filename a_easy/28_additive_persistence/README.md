Have the function ```AdditivePersistence(num)``` take the ```num``` parameter being passed which will always be a positive integer and return its additive persistence which is the number of times you must add the digits in ```num``` until you reach a single digit. For example: if ```num``` is **2718** then your program should return **2** because 2 + 7 + 1 + 8 = 18 and 1 + 8 = 9 and you stop at 9.

Use the **Parameter Testing** feature in the box below to test your code with different arguments.
